We are writing a desktop application for the classic game of Checkers. The purpose of the application is to allow the user to play the board game against another user or a computer opponent. The app features a classic 8x8 checkerboard with your standard 24 checker pieces that the players can move with their mouse.
Additional features include a ranking system, timer, leaderboards, and a chat box. It will also include options within the game such as surrender, propose takeback, and setting difficulty for AI.
As of now, the app will only serve a single user.

Language: Java
GUI: JavaFX
Database: Possibly SQL (undecided for the moment)
Type: Computer Application

This app  will include:

User database with rated and unrated matches
Matches versus increasingly strong AI
Keep match history with win/loss ratio
Matches with users/ai will include: timers, board+pieces, surrender/propose take back.
Save matches for another date (able to reload/resume matches after closing app).
Option for different game modes (Unlimited,1 minute, 5 minute, Kings, Flying Kings, Puzzles)
